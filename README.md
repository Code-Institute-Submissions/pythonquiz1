RIDDLE ME THIS

This project was designed to test my skills with my first python project.  
I have created a Riddle with 19 questions which must be completed.
The user starts by entering a username and after the username is entered 
they can start answering the questions. If the wrong answer is given then
it will be stored along with there username.

UX

the design of this was so that users could complete a simple quiz.
the quiz is designed to be entertaining and there are a number of fucntions
to increase the user experience. The ability to create a username and to see
your own as well as previous wrong answers by other users. 

FEATURES

Username creation is very simple and stored in a txt file using Json

Questions and answers of the quiz are used with a simple loop and also JSON.
there is a question ID which allows the correct answer to be identified and from
the txt file.

usernames and wrong asnwers are printed for the user to see and also written 
into a txt file.

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE

The most useful feature would be a timer and a score bored so there
is a pole of who completed the quiz the fastest.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

The testing is done using unittest and I have tested that pages load and that data is rendered correctly on it.
all 4 tests pass
